Description
Near BOS Defi Collector is a project that aims to simplify access to various DeFi platforms by aggregating them on a single webpage. Users can easily access different DeFi platforms without having to navigate to multiple websites.

Lido
Lido is a decentralized staking service for Ethereum 2.0 that allows users to stake their ETH tokens and receive stETH tokens in return, which represent their staked ETH plus rewards. Lido aims to make staking more accessible and secure for users by eliminating the need for extensive technical knowledge and infrastructure.

Additional Information
This project is built on the Near Protocol, which is a decentralized application platform that allows developers to build scalable, secure, and decentralized applications. The project is also part of the BOSAGORA ecosystem, which is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a sustainable and transparent infrastructure for decentralized applications.

Future Plans
In addition to Lido, the project aims to integrate other popular DeFi platforms such as Uniswap, Compound, and Aave. The team also plans to add additional features such as portfolio tracking and yield farming tools to further enhance the user experience.
